// controllers are just middleware but with the intent of returning data
// so they handle what a route + verb combo can access from the db
// controllers implements the logic that interacts with our database models
// instead of writing a controller for everysingle crud function, we can have generalized controlers
// import model
// import generic controllers from utils/crud
